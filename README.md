# PubSubPattern

This is a example of the pubSub Pattern in Javascript, using Require.js and Jquery. 


In this repository there is two branches, the first one is the traditional-application branch, that works like a traditional app without the pattern. The second one (pubsub-application) is the branch implementing the pattern.
